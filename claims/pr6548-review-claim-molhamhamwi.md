## What I reviewed

`node/utxo_genesis_migration.py` and `node/test_utxo_genesis_migration_units.py` for exact legacy `balance_rtc` conversion during UTXO genesis migration.

## Why I liked it

The patch replaces SQL REAL multiplication/flooring with exact `Decimal(str(value))` conversion to nanoRTC and rejects sub-nanoRTC precision. That is a fail-closed migration behavior that avoids silently truncating or minting legacy balances, and the tests cover both decimal preservation and rejection of over-precise values.

## Verification

- `python3 -m py_compile node/utxo_genesis_migration.py node/test_utxo_genesis_migration_units.py`
- `PYTHONPATH=node python3 -m pytest node/test_utxo_genesis_migration_units.py -q` → 4 passed

I received RTC compensation for this review.
